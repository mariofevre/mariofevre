- I’m Maro Fevre.
- I'm kinda coding outsider.
- I code to resolve my undestanding on environmental, city building and construction site related issues.
- I am also a teacher, so code empowering people to take better choices for themselves and their comunities is kind of my thing.
- I mostly use php and js to access data.
- Free your mind! Go for free software!
